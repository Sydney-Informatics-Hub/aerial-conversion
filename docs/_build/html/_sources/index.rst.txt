This is an Open source tools enabling interchange between computer vision annotation and GIS data formats. Part of `PIPE-3956 Aerial Segmentation <https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/PIPE-3956-aerial-segmentation>`__. 
The code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/aerial-conversion>`__.

Basic Usage
===========


Input and Output Data Formats
-----------------------------

The repository can convert between the following formats:

-  Images and annotations in COCO JSON format.

-  Georeferenced shapefile polygon vector files, with a readme file
   linking to the original web map server or aerial imagery source to be
   rendered.

--------------

Setup
-----

::

   conda create -n aerial-conversion-dev python==3.9

   conda activate aerial-conversion-dev

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
-------

A toy dataset has been uploaded to Roboflow. It is a small subset,
containing Chatswood region, available
`here <https://universe.roboflow.com/sih-vpfnf/gis-hd-200x200>`__.

There are multiple versions of this dataset. Please ignore the first
version. Version 2 and later versions are the ones that are being used.
The main difference of version 2 and 3 is that `version
2 <https://universe.roboflow.com/sih-vpfnf/gis-hd-200x200/2>`__ contains
90 degree augmentaions, while `version
3 <https://universe.roboflow.com/sih-vpfnf/gis-hd-200x200/3>`__ does
not.

For implementing this in your code, you can use the following code
snippet:

.. code:: python

   from roboflow import Roboflow
    
   rf = Roboflow(api_key= 'your_roboflow_api_key' )
   workspace_name = "sih-vpfnf" 
   dataset_version = 3 
   project_name = "gis-hd-200x200" 
   dataset_download_name = "coco-segmentation" 

   project = rf.workspace(workspace_name).project(project_name)
   dataset = project.version(dataset_version).download(dataset_download_name)

Usage
-----

To create tiles from a raster file, use the following command:

::

   python geojson2coco.py \
                   --raster-file /path/to/data/chatswood_hd.tif \
                   --polygon-file /path/to/data/chatswood.geojson \
                   --tile-dir /path/to/data/big_tiles \
                   --json-name /path/to/data/coco_from_gis_hd.json \
                   --info /path/to/data/info.json \
                   --class-column zone_name 

To merge multiple COCO JSON files, and yield a geojson file for the
input raster, use the following command:

::

   python coco2geojson.py \
                   /path/to/data/raster_tiles/dir \
                   /path/to/data/predictions-coco.json \
                   --tile-extension .tif \
                   --geojson-output /path/to/data/output.geojson \
                   --meta-name <name_of_the_dataset>
                   --minimum-rotated-rectangle

Contributing to the Project
---------------------------

Please make sure to install all the required libraries in the
`requirements.txt <https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/aerial-conversion/tree/main/requirements.txt>`__
file for development.

Commit rules:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this project, ``pre-commit`` is being used. Hence, please make sure
you have it in your env by ``pip install pre-commit``.

Make sure to run pre-commit on each run. You can run it before commit on
all files to check your code by typing
``pre-commit run --all-files --verbose``, without staging your
pre-commit config. Otherwise, you can run it via ``pre-commit run``
only, or just envoking it while committing (and failing, and committing
again).

Alternatively, to add the hook, after installing pre-commit, run:

::

   pre-commit install

Documentation update:
---------------------

-  To update the documentation, navigate to the
   `docs <https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/aerial-conversion/tree/main/docs/>`__
   directory.
-  Remove the old ``rst`` files from the the docs directory, except
   ``index.rst``. 
-  Make sure ``index.rst`` is not empty.
-  Make sure there is a ``config.py`` file in the ``docs`` directory, containing the root directory, version, and other project details.
-  Navigate to the upper directory: ``cd ..``.
-  Input ``sphinx-apidoc -o docs .`` to regenerate the ``rst`` files.
-  Navigate back to the ``docs`` directory.
-  Update the ``index.rst`` file to include the new ``rst`` files, if
   required. Usually not needed. (You donâ€™t have to include the submodules.)
-  Then input ``make html`` for updating the html file.
