This is an open-source tool enabling interchange between computer vision annotation and GIS data formats. Part of `PIPE-3956 Aerial Segmentation <https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/PIPE-3956-aerial-segmentation>`__. 
The code is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/aerial-conversion>`__.

Basic Usage
===========


Input and Output Data Formats
-----------------------------

The repository can convert between the following formats:

-  Images and annotations in COCO JSON format.

-  Georeferenced shapefile polygon vector files, with a readme file
   linking to the original web map server or aerial imagery source to be
   rendered.

--------------

Setup
-----

::

   conda create -n aerial-conversion-dev python==3.9

   conda activate aerial-conversion-dev

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset
-------

A toy dataset has been uploaded to Roboflow. It is a small subset,
containing Chatswood region, available
`here <https://universe.roboflow.com/sih-vpfnf/gis-hd-200x200>`__.

There are multiple versions of this dataset. Please ignore the first
version. Version 2 and later versions are the ones that are being used.
The main difference of version 2 and 3 is that `version
2 <https://universe.roboflow.com/sih-vpfnf/gis-hd-200x200/2>`__ contains
90 degree augmentaions, while `version
3 <https://universe.roboflow.com/sih-vpfnf/gis-hd-200x200/3>`__ does
not.

For implementing this in your code, you can use the following code
snippet:

.. code:: python

   from roboflow import Roboflow
    
   rf = Roboflow(api_key= 'your_roboflow_api_key' )
   workspace_name = "sih-vpfnf" 
   dataset_version = 3 
   project_name = "gis-hd-200x200" 
   dataset_download_name = "coco-segmentation" 

   project = rf.workspace(workspace_name).project(project_name)
   dataset = project.version(dataset_version).download(dataset_download_name)




Usage
-----

To create tiles from a raster file, use the following command:

::

   python geojson2coco.py \
                   --raster-file /path/to/data/chatswood_hd.tif \
                   --polygon-file /path/to/data/chatswood.geojson \
                   --tile-dir /path/to/data/big_tiles \
                   --json-name /path/to/data/coco_from_gis_hd.json \
                   --info /path/to/data/info.json \
                   --class-column zone_name 

To merge multiple COCO JSON files, and yield a geojson file for the
input raster, use the following command:

::

   python coco2geojson.py \
                   /path/to/data/raster_tiles/dir \
                   /path/to/data/predictions-coco.json \
                   --tile-extension .tif \
                   --geojson-output /path/to/data/output.geojson \
                   --meta-name <name_of_the_dataset>
                   --minimum-rotated-rectangle 



To do a batch conversion, when the conversion should be carried on
multiple input images, use the following command:

::

   python batch_coco2geojson.py \
                   --raster-dir /path/to/data/rasters/ \
                   --vector-dir /path/to/data/geojsons/ \
                   --output-dir /path/to/data/outputs/ \
                   --tile-size <size_of_the_tiles>
                   --class-column <class_column_in_geojsons_to_look_for>
                   --overlap <overlap_in_percentage_between_tiles> \
                   --pattern <a_pattern_to_ensure_raster_names_matches_the_geojsons>
                   --concatenate <whether_to_concatenate_the_output_geojsons_into_one_big_json>
                   --info /path/to/data/info.json \
                   --resume <whether_to_resume_the_process_in_case_new_images_are_added>

``--raster-dir`` argument is the path to the raster directory. This is a
necessary argument. Rasters are expected to be in this directory.

``--vector-dir`` argument is the path to the vector directory. This is a
necessary argument. geojsons are expected to be in this directory, with
matching names with the rasters.

Please ensure the rasters in the raster directory are named similarly as
the geojsons. If they only differ in a prefix, you can use the
``--pattern`` argument to specify the prefix. For example, if the
rasters are named ``osm_1.tif``, ``osm_2.tif``, and the geojsons are
named ``1.geojson``, ``2.geojson``, you can use ``--pattern osm_`` to
ensure the rasters are matched with the geojsons.

``--output-dir`` argument is the path to the output directory. This is a
necessary argument.

``--class-column`` argument is also a necessary argument that should be
provided. If the provided argument is wrong or does not exist, the code
will create the column with default values.

``--overlap`` argument is the percentage of overlap between the tiles.
For example, if the tile size is 200, and the overlap is 0.5, the
overlap between the tiles will be 100 pixels.

``--concatenate`` argument is a store-true argument. If it is set, the
output geojsons will be concatenated into one big geojson.

``--resume`` argument is a store-true argument. If it is set, the code
will resume the process from the last image that was processed. This is
useful when new images are added to the raster directory, and the
process should be resumed from the last image that was processed.

``--info`` argument is the path to the info json file. This is a
necessary argument. If the argument is not provided, the code will
create the info json file with default values.

``--tile-size`` argument is the size of the tiles in meters.

Contributing to the Project
---------------------------

Please make sure to install all the required libraries in the
`requirements.txt <https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/aerial-conversion/tree/main/requirements.txt>`__
file for development.

Commit rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this project, ``pre-commit`` is being used. Hence, please make sure
you have it in your env by ``pip install pre-commit``.

Make sure to run pre-commit on each run. You can run it before commit on
all files to check your code by typing
``pre-commit run --all-files --verbose``, without staging your
pre-commit config. Otherwise, you can run it via ``pre-commit run``
only, or just envoking it while committing (and failing, and committing
again).

Alternatively, to add the hook, after installing pre-commit, run:

::

   pre-commit install



Documentation update
---------------------

-  To update the documentation, navigate to the
   `docs <https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/aerial-conversion/tree/main/docs/>`__
   directory.
-  Remove the old ``rst`` files from the the docs directory, except
   ``index.rst``. 
-  Make sure ``index.rst`` is not empty.
-  Make sure there is a ``config.py`` file in the ``docs`` directory, containing the root directory, version, and other project details.
-  Navigate to the upper directory: ``cd ..``.
-  Input ``sphinx-apidoc -o docs .`` to regenerate the ``rst`` files.
-  Navigate back to the ``docs`` directory.
-  Update the ``index.rst`` file to include the new ``rst`` files, if
   required. Usually not needed. (You donâ€™t have to include the submodules.)
-  Then input ``make html`` for updating the html file.
